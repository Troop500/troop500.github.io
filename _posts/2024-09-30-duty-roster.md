A [duty roster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WoU7X7_iQpEmeKjruu3_1O0eYzCjial3/view?usp=sharing) is a list of jobs that needs to be done at a campout. Each patrol will have their own duty roster. The patrol leader will set one up by seeing who all is going to that campout and figure out who would be good at that job or if they need it for rank (like being grubmaster) but also rotating it out so it's fair among the patrol. Jobs that are found on a duty roster are water master, fire master, head cook, assistant cook, campsite cleanup and kitchen clean up. Other jobs can be added if the patrol feels like they need them. The head cook is usually grubmaster so if they need it for rank or a merit badge they can get that requirement.
