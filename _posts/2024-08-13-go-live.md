Welcome to the Troop 500 website! This page will get lots of updates and new content as we have girls take on the Webmaster position, but for now I'm posting it to provide a single, clear page where families and Scouts can get information about the Troop. The [events](/events) page will be kept up-to-date with all the latest events that are on our schedule along with links to RSVP for those events. This should make finding those links easier! 

I've also rehosted our "Guide to Your First Year" document on the [For Families](/families). There's a lot of good material in there that everyone should be familiar with, regardless how long you have been with the Troop.

If you have ideas on new content, find mistakes, or want to provide any feedback please don't hesitate to send me an email!
